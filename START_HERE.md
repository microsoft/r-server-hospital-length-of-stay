## Quick Start
-----------------
 
 There are multiple ways you can try this solution package out for yourself.

* Visit the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery]({{ site.aka_url }}) and use the `Deploy` button.  All necessary software will be installed and configured for you as well as the initial deployment of the solution.  You will be all set to follow along with the [Typical Workflow](CIG_Workflow.html) on the deployed virtual machine.

* For an On-Prem installation, follow [these instructions](SetupSQL.html) to setup the server.    

    * Once the server is configured, you can use the [PowerShell Instructions](Powershell_Instructions.html) for a quick deployment of all tables to your own machine.

    * Or you can run all the R or Python Scripts following the path for Debra the data scientist in the [Typical Workflow](Typical_Workflow.html).
