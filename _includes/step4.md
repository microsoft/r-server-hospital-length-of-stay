## Step 4: Deploy and Visualize with Caroline and Chris 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Now that the models are in place and the dashboard is built, we will meet our last two personas - Caroline the CMIO and Chris the Care Line Manager.  

### Caroline the CMIO

Caroline will use the predictions to determine if resources are being allocated appropriately in her hospital network. Her dashboard will help her to not only make determinations about what facilities are being overtaxed, but also what resources at those facilities may need to be bolstered.  For example, using the dashboard provided in this solution, Caroline is able to determine which facilities will not be discharging patients at the rate that they are coming in. Using this knowledge, she can then make recommendations to others to transfer and or re-route incoming patients to facilities that are experiencing less burden.

Additionally, Caroline will make recommendations on re-routing specific resources and personnel given demands. By using length of stay predictions, she is able to see which disease conditions are most prevalent in patients that will be staying in care facilities long term. For example, in seeing that heart failure patients are being predicted to spend a longer amounts of time in a specific facility, she will recommend additional heart failure resources be diverted to that facility.

### Chris the Care Line Manager

Chris is directly involved with the care of patients. His role requires monitoring individual patient statuses as well as ensuring that staff is avilable to meet their patients’ specific care requirements. Additionally, Chris plans for the discharge of patients; determining if the patient will be discharged during a low staff time (such as weekends).

Length of stay prediction allows Chris to better plan for his patients’ care. In the provided dashboard, Chris is able to see the number of patients under his care by selecting his facility at the top of the page. He can then see all the patients in that facility today and a predicted number of days each has left until their discharge.  This allows him to allocated appropriate resources be available for his patient population.  He can also see when patients might be projected to leave on a Saturday or Sunday and can either ensure discharge occurs, or to plan for additional days of care in the inpatient setting. Additionally, the vitals and condition breakdowns allow the care line manager to closely monitor the status of those patients projected to be in the hospital for longer periods of time in order to ensure additional complications do not arise during their stay.
